only can input numbers 0 - 9
v1,v2 = zero
c = empty string | serves no purpose
i=t=sum_val = zero
v= array of 100 empty strings

t is used for the indices in v

-------
for loop goes through all chars of expression
	if saves the first negative input
-------

Expression

Get priorities (?)

Operations

Get numbers

(disregard as bug) first elif & 2nd elif:
	get the full number from a section of input
	move i to continue after the number is captured

Program iterates through inputs
Saves numbers up until it encounters '(', ')' or a math symbol (+-/*)
-----------------
''.join(v) creates joins all characters in character array to be one string

Expressions can have
    Character merges into strings
    operations performed - could potentially be own class (+-*/)
    do nothing - program just displays num

Operations:
    + 
    -
    *
    /

Merging Strings (maybe):
    makes strings in array into 1 string
